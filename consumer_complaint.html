											<p>
												<ol>
													<li>
														<b>Submission Channels:</b>
														Web (8,016 complaints) is the most common submission platform.
														Referral (4,828 complaints) is the second-highest.
														Phone (1,866 complaints) and other channels (Postal Mail, Fax, and Web Referral) have lower submissions.

The large number of complaints closed with an explanation suggests that many issues may not require monetary compensation but rather better communication or clarification from the company.
