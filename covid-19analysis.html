												<h3>Key Insights</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												<li>
													There is a constant upward shift in total case and excess mortality from year 2020 to year 2022 then a great decrease in year 2023.
												</li>
												<li>
													There is a strong positive correlation between the total case per million and excess mortality, the more the total case the more the excess mortality.
												</li>
												<li>
													Countries with low poverty rate had more death compared to countries with high poverty rate.
												</li>
												<li>
													Countries with high GDP had more death compared to countries with low GDP.
												</li>
												<li>
													The factors that contributed to fight against Covid-19 are; Stringency Index, Total Vaccinations, Boosters and Gross Domestic Product.
												</li>
												<li>
													Human Development Index was 1% for most countries affected, that is human development index wasn’t a strong combative measure.
												</li>
												<li>
													The factors that contributed to Covid-19 are; Cardiovascular disease, Diabetes, Smoking, Limited Hospital Beds, Gross Domestic Products and Human Development Index.

												<h3>Africa</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Mayotte was greatly affected by the covid 19 pandemic, followed by South Africa in Africa. Mayotte experienced a rapid increase in excess mortality from <b>0.08%</b> to <b>0.4% </b>from year 2020 to year 2022 and slightly reduced to 0.2% in 2023. This increase also reflected in the total case from year <b>2020 (0.007%)</b> to year <b>2021 (0.06%)</b> and a slight reduction in year <b>2022 (0.055%)</b> and rapid fall in total case in year <b>2023 (0.006%)</b>. The dataset did not reflect any combative measures available for this country. Mayotte constitutes <b>0.03%</b> of the Africa’s population, and <b>0.001%</b> of the total population.	South Africa had total population of <b>60m</b> (approximately), which is <b>6%</b> of Africa’s population and <b>0.19%</b> in total population. In South Africa, there was a robust rise in excess mortality from <b>0.054%</b> in year <b>2020</b> to <b>0.8%</b> in year <b>2021</b> and rose continuously to <b>1.37%</b> in <b>2022</b> and greatly decreased to <b>0.7%</b> in <b>2023</b>. Total case experienced exponential increase from <b>0.02%</b> in year <b>2020</b> to <b>0.15%</b> in year <b>2022</b>. There was no total case of covid 19 in <b>2023</b>. In year <b>2020</b>, <b>South Africa</b> had the highest ICU patients and weekly hospital admissions.	  
											Covid 19 combative measures such as <b>Stringency Index, Booster, provision of Handwashing Facilities, Gross Domestic Products (GDP), Human Development Index (HDI).</b>
											Vaccination helped reduce the impact of covid in <b>South Africa</b>. Reproduction rate also reduced from <b>3%</b> in year <b>2020</b> and <b>2021</b> to <b>1%</b> in year <b>2022</b> and year
											<b>2023</b> which caused a rapid fall on the pandemic spread.</p>

												<h3>North America</h3>
											</header>
											<p><b>Mexico</b> was the top most country affected by covid 19 pandemic and closely followed by United states. Mexico population of <b>128m</b> people constitute to <b>0.4%</b>Of the total population and <b>21.3%</b> Of the total North America continents. There is a positive correlation between the total case and the excess mortality. An increase in total case led to an increase in excess mortality. In year <b>2020</b>, excess mortality grew from <b>43,943(0.26%) </b>to <b>213,034(1.25%)</b> in year <b>2021</b> and <b>242,086(1.42%)</b> in year <b>2022</b> and greatly decreased to <b>5,131(0.03%)</b> in year <b>2023</b>. Reproduction rate was <b>3% </b>over the first <b>3 years</b> and there were <b>1000(One Thousand) Hospital Beds</b> available which might have caused a rapid spread as it can’t curtail the total Mexican population. However, with a fixed GDP of <b>$17336</b> and <b>2%</b> of extreme poverty over the <b>4 years</b> spread, <b>Mexico</b> was able to combat the covid spread by providing <b>Handwashing Facilities, implementing Stringency Index and providing Vaccination</b> for its citizen. Though, the combative measures rate was different and unstable over the years, it helped to reduce the spread. In <b>2023</b>, there was no combative measures available but the reproduction rate reduced to <b>1% </b>thereby causing impressive deduction in excess mortality of the country’s population. </p>

											which had about <b>13.2%</b> of its total cases in South America. However, Ecuador had the highest excess mortality followed by Peru. Chile had the <b>highest vaccination and a very high GDP</b> so this helped them reduce the mortality rate.</p>
